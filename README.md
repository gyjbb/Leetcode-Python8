On the eighth day, we will learn more about Strings. 
The challenges today are about KMP algorithms, which will be finished later. Then I wrote a summary of the string questions.

## String summary
Two pointers are commonly used in arrays, linked lists, and string.\
Starting from the end to start when process a string is a useful way, like in [reading](https://github.com/youngyangyang04/leetcode-master/blob/master/problems/%E5%89%91%E6%8C%87Offer05.%E6%9B%BF%E6%8D%A2%E7%A9%BA%E6%A0%BC.md). It's more efficient.\
Firstly do a partial reverse, then do a total reverse. This also is a new way to solve questions.
